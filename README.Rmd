<!-- badges: end -->

The `IASDT.R` is an R package that aims at supporting the invasive alien species (IAS) prototype digital twin, as part of the EU-funded BioDT project. These functions help in the the preparation of IAS data and the modelling the distribution of IAS across Europe.

This function is currently hosted at [https://git.ufz.de/biodt/IASDT.R](https://git.ufz.de/biodt/IASDT.R).

More information on the BioDT project can be found at this [link](https://biodt.eu/)
