# IASDT.R R-package

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%")

.Today <- paste0("Last update: ", lubridate::today())
```

The `IASDT.R` R package supports the invasive alien species (IAS) prototype Digital Twin (`IAS-pDT`), as part of the EU-funded [`BioDT`](https://biodt.eu/) project. This package provides functions for processing input data (biotic and abiotic) and modeling the distribution of IAS across Europe using joint species distribution models. By the end of the project, it is planned that the package will enable end users to access model outputs (e.g., prediction maps) directly from R.

More information on the BioDT project can be found at this [`link`](https://biodt.eu/). For more information on the IAS-pDT, see [`Khan, El-Gabbas, et al. (2024)`](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e124579) <br/>
