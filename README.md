# IASDT.R R-package

The `IASDT.R` is an R package that aims at supporting the invasive alien
species (IAS) prototype digital twin, as part of the EU-funded BioDT
project. These functions help in the the preparation of IAS data and the
modelling the distribution of IAS across Europe. This package is
currently hosted at <https://git.ufz.de/biodt/IASDT.R>.

More information on the BioDT project can be found at this

## Installing the package

The `IASDT.R` package is still at an early development stage and
currently stores some helper function needed for the input data
processing and modelling of the IAS across Europe. The package is
currently private (hosted at: <https://git.ufz.de/>). This means that
only users with access rights to the git repository can use the package
using a valid private access token (PAT) authentication.

By mid-2024, the package will be publicly available at the BioDT [github
organization](https://github.com/BioDT).

It is planned that the package will allow end users to access model
outputs (e.g.Â prediction maps) by the end of 2024.

### Set PAT

To install the package, you need to set a valid gitlab PAT first. You
can create a PAT by visiting this
[link](https://git.ufz.de/biodt/IASDT.R/-/settings/access_tokens). After
creating the PAT, you need to add it to the `.Renviron` file. For more
information on the `.Renviron` file, click
[here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf).

In an interactive RStudio session, you add the PAT by using:

``` r
require(usethis)
require(remotes)
```

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()                             # global `.Renviron` file
# or altetnatively
# usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "project")          # project-specific settings
```

This opens the `.Renviron` file. You need to add the following line to
the file (replace `ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ` with your valid PAT)

``` r
GITLAB_PAT=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
```

Then you need to save the `.Renviron` file and ensure that it ends with
a newline.

RStudio should be restarted for making such changes effective. After you
restart RStudio, you can check the value of the `GITLAB_PAT` environment
variable by using the following command:

``` r
Sys.getenv("GITLAB_PAT")
```

### Install the package

To install the package you can use the following command

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "BioDT/IASDT.R", host = "git.ufz.de")
```

Alternatively, you can provide the PAT directly to the
`remotes::install_gitlab` function; however, this is not recommended.

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "BioDT/IASDT.R", host = "git.ufz.de", auth_token = "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ")
```

### Update the package

To update the package, use the following

``` r
remotes::update_packages("IASDT.R")
```

or re-install it; you can use `force = TRUE` to force installation, even
if the remote state has not changed since the previous install.

``` r
# remotes::install_gitlab(repo = "BioDT/IASDT.R", host = "git.ufz.de")
```

### Contribute to the package

Your contribution to the package is welcome. Please make your changes to
a different branch and submit a pull request.
