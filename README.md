The `IASDT.R` is an R package that aims at supporting the invasive alien
species (IAS) prototype digital twin, as part of the EU-funded BioDT
project. These functions help in the the preparation of IAS data and the
modelling the distribution of IAS across Europe.

This function is currently hosted at <https://git.ufz.de/biodt/IASDT.R>.
