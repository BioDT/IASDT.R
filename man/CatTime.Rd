CatTime(
  Text = "",
  NLines = 1L,
  Time = TRUE,
  Bold = FALSE,
  Red = FALSE,
  Date = FALSE,
  TZ = "CET",
  Level = 0L,

\arguments{
\item{Text}{character; the text to print before the timestamp. If empty
(default), only the timestamp is printed.}

\item{NLines}{integer; the number of newline characters to print after the
message. Default is 1.}

\item{Time}{logical; whether to include the time in the timestamp. Default is
\code{TRUE}. If \code{FALSE}, only the text is printed.}

\item{Red}{logical; whether to print the text in red. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{Date}{logical; whether to include the date in the timestamp. Only
effective if \code{Time} is \code{TRUE}. Default is \code{FALSE}, meaning only the time is
printed. If \code{TRUE}, the date is printed in the format "\%d/\%m/\%Y \%X".}

\item{TZ}{character; the time zone to use for the timestamp. Default is
\code{CET}.}

\item{Level}{integer; the level at which the message will be printed. If e.g.
Level = 1, the following string will be printed at the beginning of the

print after the message.
