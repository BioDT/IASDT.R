\usage{
mod_merge_chains(
  model_dir = NULL,
  n_cores = 8L,
  strategy = "future::multicore",
  model_info_name = NULL,
  print_incomplete = TRUE,
  from_JSON = FALSE,
  out_extension = "qs2"
)

mod_merge_chains_CV(
  model_dir = NULL,
  n_cores = 8L,

  CV_names = c("CV_Dist", "CV_Large"),
  from_JSON = FALSE,
  out_extension = "qs2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_dir}{Character. Path to the root directory where the model was
fitted. For \code{mod_merge_chains}, subdirectories \code{Model_Fitted} and
\code{Model_Coda} are created within this path to store the merged \code{Hmsc} and
\code{coda} objects, respectively. For \code{mod_merge_chains_CV}, merged objects are
stored under \code{Model_Fitting_CV/Model_Fitted}.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing.
Defaults to 8L.}

\item{strategy}{Character. The parallel processing strategy to use. Valid
options are "future::sequential", "future::multisession",
"future::multicore", and "future::cluster". Defaults to
\code{"future::multicore"} (\code{"future::multisession"} on Windows). See
\code{\link[future:plan]{future::plan()}} and \code{\link[ecokit:set_parallel]{ecokit::set_parallel()}} for details.}

\item{model_info_name}{Character. Name of the file (without extension) where
updated model information is saved. If \code{NULL}, overwrites the existing
\code{Model_Info.RData} file in \code{model_dir} directory. If specified, creates a
new \code{.RData} file with this name in \code{model_dir} directory. Applies only to
\code{mod_merge_chains}.}

\item{print_incomplete}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, prints the names of model
variants that failed to merge due to missing or incomplete chains. Defaults
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{from_JSON}{Logical. Whether to convert loaded models from JSON format
before reading. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{out_extension}{Character. File extension (without dot) for output files
containing merged \code{Hmsc} and \code{coda} objects. Options are \code{qs2} (faster
read/write via the \code{qs2} package) or \code{RData} (standard R format). Defaults
to \code{qs2}.}

\item{CV_names}{Character vector. Names of cross-validation strategies to
merge, matching those used during model setup. Defaults to \code{c("CV_Dist", "CV_Large")}. The names should be one of \code{CV_Dist}, \code{CV_Large}, or
\code{CV_SAC}. Applies only to \code{mod_merge_chains_CV}.}

\value{
Both functions return \code{invisible(NULL)} and save processed model
information and merged objects to disk in the specified locations.
}
\description{
These functions merge posterior chains from multiple runs of \code{Hmsc} models
into unified \code{Hmsc} and \code{coda} objects, facilitating further analysis. They
check for missing or incomplete chains, optionally report these issues, and
save the processed results to disk. \code{mod_merge_chains} handles regular
models, while \code{mod_merge_chains_CV} is designed for cross-validated models.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{mod_merge_chains} merges posterior chains from multiple runs of an \code{Hmsc}
model fitted without cross-validation. It checks for missing or incomplete
chains, aligns posteriors (using \code{alignPost = TRUE}, falling back to \code{FALSE}
if alignment fails), and saves a merged \code{Hmsc} object and a \code{coda} object for
MCMC diagnostics. It also records fitting time and memory usage from progress
files.
\item \code{mod_merge_chains_CV} performs a similar merging process for
cross-validated \code{Hmsc} models, processing each fold of the specified
\code{CV_names} separately. It saves merged \code{Hmsc} objects per fold but does not
generate \code{coda} objects.
