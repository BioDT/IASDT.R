\title{Get the remote SHA of R packages}
\usage{
Package_RemoteSha(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Character. Names of one or more R packages (quoted or unquoted)
for which to retrieve the remote SHA.}
}
\value{
A named character vector where names are the package names and values
are the corresponding remote SHAs. If a package is not found or has no
remote SHA, the value will be \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the remote SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) reference for
one or more specified R packages from their remote repositories. The SHA
uniquely identifies the version of a package's source code, useful for
reproducibility and version tracking.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{pak::lib_status()} to query the status of
installed packages and extract their remote SHAs. It supports packages
installed from GitHub, GitLab, or other remote sources via \code{pak}. If a
package is installed from CRAN or locally without a remote SHA, the result
will be \code{NA}.
