\usage{
cv_merge_predictions(
  model_prefix = NULL,
  n_cv_folds = 4L,
  hab_abb = NULL,
  spatial_model = NULL,
  n_cores = 8L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_prefix}{Character. Prefix for model output directories and files.}

\item{n_cv_folds}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds. Default is 4L.}

\item{hab_abb}{Character. Habitat abbreviation to process.}

\item{spatial_model}{Logical. Whether to use a spatial model (TRUE) or
non-spatial (FALSE).}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing. Default is
8L.}

\item{clamp}{Character vector. Indicates which prediction types to process:
"clamp", "no_clamp", or both.}
}
\description{
Merges prediction results from cross-validated Hmsc models, processes clamped
and not-clamped model outputs, and generates summary maps and anomaly
visualizations for species invasion predictions. It saves processed
prediction data and map images to disk.
